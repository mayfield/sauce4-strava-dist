                        <p><span class="saucey">Sauce Performance</span> is built on an advanced synchronization system that imports an athlete's entire activity history from Strava servers to your browser's internal storage.  It uses proven browser technology to store, index and analyze the activities without the use of 3rd party servers.  Once an athlete's activity history is synchronized, a world of new activity analysis possibilities are available!</p>

                        <dl>
                            <dt>Does it cost anything?</dt>
                            <dd>Basic functionality works for free, but you can unlock the full power for $2/month via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sauce4strava" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</dd>

                            <dt>How does <span class="saucey">Sauce</span> get activity data?</dt>
                            <dd><span class="saucey">Sauce</span> uses the same servers and webpages that the normal Strava website uses.   No special API access or 3rd party servers are used.</dd>

                            <dt>Why does the sync process take so long the first time?</dt>
                            <dd>If activity data is imported too quickly, Strava will temporarily rate-limit your account.  <span class="saucey">Sauce</span> is programmed to stay safely within these limits as long as you only sync one device at a time.</dd>

                            <dt>Why does <span class="saucey">Sauce</span> need to "Synchronize" my data for the Performance features?</dt>
                            <dd>To provided advanced training and historical data access, it is necessary to have direct access to all data in one place.  <span class="saucey">Sauce Performance</span> makes use your browser's own storage facility to do this.

                            <dt>Where is all this data being stored?</dt>
                            <dd>In your web browser's storage system called "IndexedDB."  This is a built-in database that, for most platforms, is capable of storing and querying gigabytes of data efficiently.  Data stays with <b>you</b> on <b>your</b> device.</dd>

                            <dt>How do I protect my data?</dt>
                            <dd>Backups, backups, backups!  Use the "Export Data" feature in the sync control panel to create backup files that you can place somewhere safe.</dd>
